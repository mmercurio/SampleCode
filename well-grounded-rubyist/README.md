Ruby code examples and exercises from [_The Well-Grounded Rubyist_, Third Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-rubyist-third-edition) by David A. Black and Joseph Leo III.

The Third Edition of the book references Ruby version 2.5.1. All of the sample code in this repo was executed against [Ruby version 2.7.5](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2021/11/24/ruby-2-7-5-released/).

Beginning with Chapter 13, I started using Ruby version 3.2.x because Ruby 2.7 is [no longer receiving updates](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2023/03/30/ruby-2-7-8-released/) and considered EOL.
